# Text Summarization App

Welcome to the Text Summarization App! This application leverages the power of Hugging Face's BART model to provide high-quality text summarization. The app is built using Gradio, a user-friendly interface for machine learning models.

## Features

- **Input Text**: Enter the text you want to summarize.
- **Summarize**: Click the "üîç Summarize" button to generate a summary of the input text.
- **Reset**: Clear the input and output fields with the "üîÑ Reset" button.
- **Provide Feedback**: Provide feedback on the generated summary with the "üëç Provide Feedback" button.
- **Load Example**: Load a sample text to see how the summarization works.

## How to Use

1. **Enter Text**: Type or paste the text you want to summarize into the "Input Text" box.
2. **Summarize**: Click the "üîç Summarize" button to generate a summary.
4. **Reset**: Click the "üîÑ Reset" button to clear the input and output fields.
5. **Feedback**: Provide feedback on the summary using the "üëç Provide Feedback" button.
6. **Example**: Click the "üìÑ Load Example" button to load a sample text.

## Model

This app uses the [BART model](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn) from Hugging Face, which is a powerful transformer model for text summarization.
